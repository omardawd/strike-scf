# Strike SCF — Claude Code Project Guide

> Read this file completely before touching any code. It is your map.

## What this project is

Strike SCF is a **Supply Chain Finance (SCF) platform** for three distinct user types:
- **Banks** — create programs, review KYB, make credit decisions, approve financing, monitor risk
- **Anchors** (large buyers like Pacific Dynamics) — invite suppliers, approve invoices
- **Suppliers** (SMBs like Westcoast Fabricators) — submit invoices for early payment

The same Next.js app serves all three portals. Portal type is derived from `users.role` at login and stored in `PortalContext`.

> Sidebar nav is **role-aware & flat** (`components/sidebar.tsx`). Collapses to icon-only mode (56px width); persisted in localStorage `strike_sidebar_collapsed`. All labels below are what users currently see — removed items (Settings, AI Agent, My Programs, Transactions, KYB Review) still have pages but no sidebar link.
>
> **Strike AI** (`/ai`) is rendered as a special featured button at the **top** of the nav (above all other items) for all portals — blue→purple gradient pill with shimmer animation. It is NOT part of the `ANCHOR_NAV` / `SUPPLIER_NAV` / `BANK_NAV` / `ADMIN_NAV` arrays; it is hardcoded in the nav render above the `sections.map()` loop. Do not add it to the nav arrays.

## Role system

```typescript
// From packages/types/index.ts — always import from here
type UserRole =
  | 'bank_admin'
  | 'bank_credit_officer'
  | 'org_admin'        // org-level admin (anchor OR supplier — org.type decides)
  | 'org_member'
  | 'strike_admin'     // Strike platform admin

const BANK_ROLES = ['bank_admin', 'bank_credit_officer']
const ORG_ROLES  = ['org_admin', 'org_member']
```

> NOTE (v2): the old `anchor_*` / `supplier_*` roles are GONE. Orgs use `org_admin` / `org_member`; whether an org is a buyer (anchor) or supplier comes from `organizations.type`, not the role.

Portal derivation (`lib/portal-context.tsx`, `PortalType = 'bank'|'anchor'|'supplier'|'admin'`):
`bank_admin`/`bank_credit_officer` → `'bank'`; `org_admin`/`org_member` → `org.type` (`'anchor'` = BUYER, or `'supplier'`); `strike_admin` → `'admin'`.

---

## API route pattern — follow exactly

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
import { createClient as createAdmin } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

const adminClient = createAdmin(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
)

export async function GET() {
  // 1. Auth — anon client only for getUser()
  const supabase = await createClient()
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
  if (!user) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })

  // 2. User row — admin client (need role/bank/org regardless of RLS)
  const { data: userData } = await adminClient
    .from('users')
    .select('id, role, org_id, bank_id')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .single()
  if (!userData) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'User not found' }, { status: 401 })

  // 3. Role gate
  if (!BANK_ROLES.includes(userData.role)) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 })
  }

  // 4. Scoped data query — always filter to user's bank/org
  const { data, error } = await adminClient
    .from('programs')
    .select('*')
    .eq('bank_id', userData.bank_id)
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })

  if (error) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Query failed' }, { status: 500 })
  return NextResponse.json({ programs: data ?? [] })
}
```

Inline the pattern above in each route (auth → user row → role gate → scoped query).
There is no shared auth helper module — `lib/api-auth.ts` was deleted (T1.5): it used
the deprecated `getSession()` and had zero importers. Do **not** reintroduce it.

**RLS is enabled.** Admin client bypasses it — always add a manual `.eq()` scope. See `skills/supabase-patterns.md`.

---

## Key field names to get right (common mistakes)

```
banks.legal_name, banks.display_name      ← NOT banks.name
transactions.financing_amount_requested   ← requested by supplier
transactions.financing_amount_approved    ← approved by bank (may differ)
transactions.invoice_due_date             ← the invoice's original due date
transactions.repayment_due_date           ← when bank gets repaid
invitations.anchor_org_id                 ← NOT invitations.org_id
documents                                 ← single unified table (no kyb_documents, no collateral table)
collateral_requirements                   ← collateral pledging (NOT a table called 'collateral')
organizations.risk_tier                   ← type: 'A'|'B'|'C'|'D' (NOT 'green'|'amber'|'red')
```

Note: `risk_tier` on `organizations` is `A|B|C|D`. The `green/amber/red` labels used in
the risk scoring API (`/api/risk/score`) are a separate computed display value stored
alongside but distinct from the formal `risk_tier` enum.

---

## Page pattern — portal pages

```typescript
'use client'
import { usePortal } from '@/lib/portal-context'  // 'bank'|'anchor'|'supplier'
import { useUser } from '@/lib/user-context'        // { id, full_name, email, role, org_id, bank_id }
import { PortalShell, Topbar } from '@/components/portal-shell'

export default function MyPage() {
  const portal = usePortal()
  const user = useUser()
  // fetch from /api/... on mount, render with PortalShell + Topbar
}
```

### AI context injection (required on every portal page)

Every portal page must set `data-page-name` and `data-ai-context` on its outermost container so
the AI overlay and `StrikeAIPanel` have full context for responses:

```tsx
<div
  data-page-name="My Page Name"
  data-ai-context={JSON.stringify({
    /* structured data relevant to the page — deals, listings, org info, etc. */
    portal,
    user_role: user?.role,
    // ... page-specific fields
  })}
>
```

The `ai-overlay.tsx` reads these via `document.querySelector('[data-page-name]')`. Always use
`JSON.stringify(...)` — plain strings are silently dropped. Every portal page in the app sets this.

---

## Design system (2026 "soft / curved / premium" redesign)

Tokens in `app/globals.css` (+ `app/marketplace.css` for Strike Place/Rooms/Passport classes). Never hardcode colors — use tokens. Corners are now ROUNDED everywhere (the old global `border-radius: 0 !important` rule was removed).

```css
--white:#FFFFFF  --offwhite:#F5F4F0  --ink:#0D0D0D  --ink-soft  --gray:#6B7280  --gray-soft:#9CA3AF
--border:rgba(0,0,0,.06)  --border-strong:rgba(0,0,0,.12)
--blue:#1428CC  --blue-hover:#0F1FA3  --blue-light:#EEF0FF      /* Strike brand blue */
--font-display / --font-body:  "Plus Jakarta Sans"             /* ALL UI text */
--font-mono: "IBM Plex Mono"   /* ONLY transaction IDs / code values — not UI chrome */

/* Semantic (pastel bg + saturated text) */
--color-green:#10B981 (bg #EDFAF4)  --color-amber:#F59E0B (bg #FEF3C7)
--color-red:#EF4444 (bg #FEE2E2)    --color-purple:#7C3AED

/* Radius + shadow tokens */
--radius-card:20px  --radius-input:12px  --radius-button/-badge:999px  --radius-nav:12px  --radius-sm:8px
--shadow-card  --shadow-elevated  --shadow-button
```

Conventions: cards = `--radius-card` + `--shadow-card`; buttons & badges = full pill (999px); inputs = 12px; sidebar active nav = `--blue-light` pill (no left-border accent). No `transform: translateY` hover lifts. No Shadcn, no Tailwind, no MUI — all hand-built CSS; check existing classes first.

## AI features

### Surfaces

- `app/(portal)/ai/page.tsx` (+ `ai/layout.tsx`) — the dedicated **Strike AI** page. Features:
  - localStorage conversation history, per-portal quick prompts
  - Agentic "wants to execute an action" confirmation card
  - **File upload / document attachment**: paperclip button → `POST /api/ai/upload` → extracted text
    prepended to message as `[Attached document: "filename"]\n\n{text}\n\n---\n\n{user message}`.
    Supports PDF (Claude reads via `document` block), images (Claude reads via `image` block),
    plain text / CSV / JSON / Markdown (decoded directly), DOCX/DOC/XLSX (printable-text extraction).
    Max 20 MB. Attachment pill shown in message bubble; content truncated from display after `---`.
  - Sends `model: 'sonnet'` to `/api/ai/chat`. Linked from the sidebar (`/ai`).
  - **Agentic tool use**: `/api/ai/chat` returns `tool_use` blocks → UI shows a confirmation card;
    on confirm, calls `POST /api/ai/tools/execute` → result injected as next `tool_result` message.

- `components/ai-overlay.tsx` — global overlay mounted in `portal-shell.tsx` on every page **except**
  `/ai`: a hover-pill at the bottom edge + a draggable floating cluster after the first message.
  Reads page context from the `data-page-name` / `data-ai-context` DOM attributes set on the
  main container; listens for the `strike-ai-prompt` CustomEvent (dispatched by insight cards).
  Has web search enabled (passes `search_web` + `get_financing_programs` tools for overlay sessions).
  Every portal page sets `data-ai-context` with structured JSON for fully contextual responses.

- `components/strike-ai-panel.tsx` — `StrikeAIPanel`: collapsible right-side AI context panel
  (300px width). Open/closed state persisted in localStorage `strike-ai-panel-open`. On open,
  fetches a contextual insight via `/api/ai/insight` using the current page's `data-page-name` /
  `data-ai-context`. Clears history on route change. Currently defined but not imported into any
  layout (standalone component, available for future integration).

- `components/ai-insight-card.tsx` — contextual insight banner/compact/floating cards → `/api/ai/insight`
  (session-cached, 5-min TTL). Wired into dashboard (bank), programs, transactions.
- `components/ai-insight.tsx` — inline collapsible insight widget → `/api/ai/chat`.
- `components/doc-generator.tsx` — document export. Template picker (regulatory: BCBS 239 / MAS 610 /
  EBA FinRep / KYB summary / invoice confirmation / anchor payment notice; plus generic:
  transaction summary / KYB report / financing request / PassportScore / audit log) + custom
  template upload → `/api/ai/documents`, with a markdown preview modal and Download PDF / .md.
- `components/ai-panel.tsx` — **deprecated/orphaned** (old sliding panel, replaced by `ai-overlay.tsx`).

### Routes

- `/api/ai/chat` — chat. Model routing: `model: 'sonnet'` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`, otherwise
  `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. Passes through optional `tools` / `tool_choice`.
- `/api/ai/insight` — insight-card JSON (haiku, 256 tokens; fail-soft).
- `/api/ai/documents` — document generation (sonnet, 4096 tokens). `custom` accepts
  `context.templateText` (fill an uploaded template) or `context.instructions`.
- `/api/ai/usage` — usage/limits for the current scope.
- `/api/ai/upload` — **multipart file upload** for Strike AI context extraction. Accepts `file` field
  (max 20 MB). Returns `{ filename, text }`. PDF/image → Claude Haiku reads content; plain text/CSV/
  JSON/MD → decoded directly; DOCX/DOC/XLSX → printable-text extraction. Usage logged to `ai_usage`
  (feature: `'insight'`). Called from `app/(portal)/ai/page.tsx` before sending message.
- `/api/ai/tools/execute` — **AI agentic tool executor**. Accepts `{ tool_name, tool_input }`.
  Auth → user row → ghost check (orgs) → bank-only gate → agent-approval preference check →
  `executeTool()` dispatch → logs to `agent_actions`. Returns `{ tool_name, result, duration_ms }`.
  On `requires_approval_for_actions` pref: returns `202 { status:'requires_approval', ... }`.

### AI Agentic Tools system (`lib/ai/tools/`)

All tools are defined in `lib/ai/tools/definitions.ts` (Claude `tool_use` schema format) and
dispatched in `lib/ai/tools/execute.ts`. Handlers live in `lib/ai/tools/handlers/`.
`lib/ai/tools/admin.ts` provides a shared service-role client for handlers.

```
ToolName (18 tools total):

READ tools (no approval gate):
  lookup_entities            — resolve name/keyword to org/deal/financing_request UUIDs; query:"all" lists recent
  get_active_deals           — list non-completed/non-cancelled deals for an org
  evaluate_supplier_passport — evaluate org trust using KYB/financials/deals/reviews; writes PassportScore back
  find_and_recommend_deals   — match + score buyer-supplier pairing; returns suggested terms
  get_pricing_insights       — benchmark product price vs platform data + LME/CME/FAO indices
  summarize_deal_negotiation — full negotiation history: events, amendments, messages, next steps
  score_and_rank_financing_offers — rank bank offers by rate/amount/tenor/bank reputation
  detect_deal_risk_signals   — fraud, risk flags, tariff exposure, payment anomalies, concentration
  recommend_suppliers_for_buyer  — best-match suppliers by product/location/PassportScore/delivery
  generate_deal_term_sheet   — structured term sheet (parties, goods, pricing, delivery, financing)
  evaluate_listing_offers    — rank offers by price/delivery speed/counterparty trust
  get_passport_advice        — explain PassportScore drivers + specific improvement actions
  search_marketplace_listings — search public listings; emits [LISTING_CARD:{id}] for each result
  search_web                 — Brave/DuckDuckGo search for market prices, regulations, benchmarks
  get_financing_programs     — fetch financing programs available to an org (overlay tool)

WRITE tools (subject to agent_preferences require_approval_for_actions gate):
  create_marketplace_listing — create listing with line items; DOCUMENT MODE: extracts all fields from
                               attached doc automatically. Emits [LISTING_CARD:{id}] on success.
  submit_marketplace_offer   — submit/bid on a listing by listing_id

BANK_ONLY tools:
  proactive_portfolio_alerts — scan bank's full portfolio for risk concentration, overdue, anomalies
```

**LISTING_CARD directive**: when a tool emits `[LISTING_CARD:{listing_id}]` on its own line,
the Strike AI page UI renders a clickable card linking to `/marketplace/listings/{listing_id}`.

**Document-mode tool calling** (create_marketplace_listing): when the user attaches a document
and asks to create a listing, the AI extracts all fields from the document and calls the tool
immediately without asking follow-up questions. The `[Attached document: "filename"]` prefix in
the message signals document mode to the AI system prompt.

### AI limits & logging

- Daily limits from `ai_limits` table (scope: user|org|bank|global), fallback hardcoded in route
- Limits: chat=50, insight=200, document=20, scoring=500
- Usage logged to `ai_usage` table (fail-soft if the table is absent)
- Tool executions logged to `agent_actions` (action_type = tool_name; fail-soft)
- Default model `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (cost-sensitive); dedicated AI page + doc gen → `claude-sonnet-4-6`

---

## Risk scoring

`/api/risk/score` — 4 components × 25 pts = 100 max:
1. KYB/compliance (from `organizations.kyb_status`)
2. Tariff/geo exposure (from `market_signals` table, `signal_type='country_risk'`)
3. Transaction performance (on-time rate from `transactions`)
4. Financial health (from `credit_scores.total_score` or `organizations.credit_score`)

Result stored on `organizations`: `risk_score` (integer), `risk_flags` (jsonb), `tariff_exposure` (jsonb).
Formal tier: `organizations.risk_tier` is `A|B|C|D` (set via credit process).
Display tier from risk score: green ≥70, amber 45–69, red <45 (separate computed value).

---

## Transaction lifecycle

```
draft → pending_anchor_initiation → pending_anchor_approval →
pending_anchor_confirmation → pending_bank_review → more_info_requested →
financing_approved_pending_collateral → financing_approved → funded →
pending_delivery_confirmation → delivery_confirmed → repayment_due →
completed | rejected | cancelled | in_dispute
```

Transaction events are logged to `transaction_events` for every status change.

---

## Environment variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
RESEND_API_KEY
CRON_SECRET              ← required; middleware gates /api/risk/refresh-signals on x-cron-secret header
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BANK_ID=ff1a209f-aa2a-471c-95c8-9d01018cdecd
```

Vercel crons (`vercel.json`):
- `/api/risk/refresh-signals` — daily 00:00 UTC (gated by `CRON_SECRET` in middleware)
- `/api/deals/check-overdue` — daily 08:00 UTC (moves overdue deals to `payment_overdue`; 2-business-day grace if financing still pending)

**External packages** (`next.config.js` `serverExternalPackages`): `pdfkit` is excluded from
webpack bundling. Any route using PDFKit must use `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`.

---

## Dev seed accounts

Created by `supabase/seed.sql` (T1.3). All passwords: `DevPass123!`.

```
sarah@atlasbank.dev     / DevPass123! → bank_admin           (Atlas Bank)
james@atlasbank.dev     / DevPass123! → bank_credit_officer  (Atlas Bank)
buyer@pacific.dev       / DevPass123! → org_admin            (Pacific Dynamics — anchor/buyer)
supplier@westcoast.dev  / DevPass123! → org_admin            (Westcoast Fabricators — supplier)
supplier@coastal.dev    / DevPass123! → org_admin            (Coastal Suppliers — supplier)
admin@strikescf.com     / DevPass123! → strike_admin         (Strike platform)
```

Atlas Bank's id is `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BANK_ID` (ff1a209f-aa2a-471c-95c8-9d01018cdecd).

---

## What NOT to do

- **Never** use `createClient()` (anon) for data queries — only for `getUser()`
- **Never** use admin client without a manual `.eq()` scope filter
- **Never** hardcode UUIDs outside seed files
- **Never** reference `kyb_submissions`, `kyb_documents`, or `collateral` — these tables don't exist
- **Never** use `invitations.org_id` — the field is `anchor_org_id`
- **Never** use `banks.name` — fields are `legal_name` and `display_name`
- **Never** use `transactions.financing_amount` — use `financing_amount_requested` or `financing_amount_approved`
- **Never** install an ORM (Prisma, Drizzle) — Supabase JS client only
- **Never** use `getSession()` in API routes — use `getUser()` (more secure)
- **Never** create a `proxy.ts` — it was renamed to `middleware.ts` (T1.1); Next.js only auto-runs `middleware.ts`. Edit the existing `apps/web/middleware.ts`.
- **Never** import `pdfkit` in a Webpack bundle — it is listed in `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.js` (added to prevent bundling). Always `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` in routes that use it.
- **Never** gate features on `organizations.status = 'active'` — use `org.network_visible && org.kyb_status !== 'not_started'` (the platform-unlock check). `status = 'active'` is only set post-approval, which is no longer required for feature access.
- **Never** add new env vars without updating `.env.production.example`
- **Don't** create Supabase clients inline in page files — import from `lib/supabase/`
- **Don't** add Redux or Zustand — use React context (already set up)

---

## TypeScript checking

```bash
# Always run from apps/web — not from the monorepo root
cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit
```

---

## Strike Place, Rooms & Passport (v2 additions)

### New route groups
- app/(portal)/marketplace/ — Strike Place hub, listings, financing
- app/(portal)/deals/ — Deal lifecycle (marketplace + imported)
- app/(portal)/rooms/ — Strike Rooms (private deal rooms + public)
- app/(portal)/passport/ — Strike Passport + peer reviews
- app/(portal)/networks/ — Anchor Supplier Networks (list + [id] detail; role-aware: anchor vs supplier view)
- app/(portal)/supply-graph/ — Supply Graph "Coming Soon" page (bank portal)
- app/(portal)/admin/ — Strike admin (strike_admin role only)
- app/(portal)/settings/agent/ — AI Agent preferences
- app/(auth)/invite/[token]/ — Network invite landing page (public, no portal shell)

### Signup flow (self-registration)

Only **anchor (buyer)** and **supplier** orgs can self-register at `/signup`. Bank accounts are provisioned manually by Strike — the signup page shows a "contact us" note instead of a bank option. There is no "both" role.

- `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` — collects role (anchor|supplier), full name, email, company name, country, password. On success, signs the user in and redirects to **`/onboarding`** (not `/dashboard`). Invite-token signups are the only exception: they redirect to `/dashboard` with a welcome message after auto-accepting the network membership.
- The signup UI uses an AI-feel design: animated gradient orbs in the background, elevated white card (`--radius-card`, strong shadow), blue→purple gradient submit button with shimmer, 2-column role cards with gradient icon on selection.
- `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` — accepts `org_type: 'anchor' | 'supplier'` only (rejects `'bank'` at the API layer too, as a backstop).

### Onboarding wizard (`app/(onboarding)/`)

- `layout.tsx` — left rail uses the actual `logo.png` image (not a placeholder "S" square). Provides `WizardContext` with the step tracker.
- `onboarding/page.tsx` — 8-step KYB/Passport activation wizard. Steps: 1 Identity & Legal, 2 Address & Contact, 3 Ownership & Compliance, 4 Financial & Trade, 5 Systems & Intent, 6 Bank Accounts (new — supplier+anchor only; saves to `bank_accounts` via `/api/settings/bank-accounts`), 7 Documents, 8 Review & Submit. At the bottom of every step's footer there is a **"Do this later — explore as guest"** button that routes to `/dashboard`. Clicking it leaves the user in ghost mode (kyb_status remains `'not_started'`); they can activate their Passport from the dashboard at any time.

### Ghost mode (Tier 0)

An org is a ghost when `kyb_status = 'not_started'` AND `network_visible = false`. This is set at signup.

- `components/ghost-gate.tsx` — `GhostGate` wraps all children in `(portal)/layout.tsx`. Detects ghost state via `useUser()` hook + `network_visible` flag; renders a lock screen for all portal pages.
- `components/ghost-lock.tsx` — `GhostLock` renders the locked-state card with "Activate Passport →" CTA.
- **Platform unlocks** when `kyb_status` changes to `'submitted'` (Passport submitted) — simultaneously sets `network_visible = true`. Users do NOT need to wait for approval.
- Ghost orgs are excluded from all counterparty queries at the API layer: every listing/financing browse route adds `.eq('network_visible', true)` filter. Ghost orgs can READ public data but never appear TO others.
- `kyb_status === 'not_started'` = locked (ghost). `kyb_status !== 'not_started'` = unlocked (all features). Approval (`'approved'`) is NOT required for feature access.

### New API routes
All new API routes follow existing patterns (service role for writes,
anon client for reads with RLS). Key routes:
- /api/marketplace/listings — CRUD for marketplace listings

### Financing-structure-aware deal flow (DEAL-FLOW implementation)

Four financing structures are a **lens** over the deal flow — steps don't change, but rendering/amounts/recipient/gates do. All logic lives in one place:

- **`lib/deals/financing-context.ts`** — `getFinancingContext(deal, txn, program, bankOrg, supplierOrg)` is the single source of truth. Returns `FinancingContext` with all UI-relevant fields. Pure function, no imports from component files. Import from here; never compute financing logic elsewhere.
- **`lib/deals/fees.ts`** — Fee calculation utilities for deal financing structures.
  - `DealFinancingStructure` = `'reverse_factoring' | 'invoice_factoring' | 'po_financing' | 'dynamic_discounting' | null` (local type — do NOT confuse with `FinancingStructure` from `packages/types/index.ts` which is `'preset'|'custom'|'open'`)
  - DB uses `type: 'factoring'` for IF; `mapStructure()` normalizes both to `'invoice_factoring'`
- **`lib/deals/transitions.ts`** — `PERMITTED_TRANSITIONS` map; `getPermittedTransition(status, action, role, fc)` returns the rule or null.
- **`components/deals/DealRoadmap.tsx`** — receives `FinancingContext` as props; zero financing logic inside.
- **`components/deals/ActionPanel.tsx`** — receives `availableActions` + `FinancingContext` as props; zero financing logic inside. Sub-components: `FinancingActiveBanner`, `DDOfferForm`, `NOAAcknowledgmentForm`, `DDRespondForm`, `GenericActionForm`.
- **Deal page (`app/(portal)/deals/[id]/page.tsx`)** computes `financingContext` via `getFinancingContext()` then passes it to both components. Sets `data-ai-context` attribute for the AI overlay.
- **RF gate**: can only request after `delivery_confirmed` (post-shipment). **PO gate**: must request at `confirmed` or `in_preparation` (pre-shipment). **IF NOA gate**: buyer must acknowledge before `confirm_payment_sent` is available. **DD flow**: anchor presents offer → supplier accept/decline.
- `transactions.repayment_routing` (TEXT): `'buyer_to_bank'` (RF/IF/PO) or `'direct'` (DD).

### Anchor Supplier Networks (NETWORKS implementation)

Networks are anchor-owned closed groups. Visibility is enforced at the API layer on every listing/financing request query.

- **`lib/networks/visibility.ts`** — single source of truth for network visibility filtering.
  - `getVisibilityFilter(admin, orgId)` → `{publicOnly, activeNetworkIds}` — call before any listing/financing browse
  - `buildListingVisibilityOr(filter, orgId)` → OR string for Supabase query builder (uses `org_id` not `poster_org_id`)
  - `isListingVisibleToOrg(admin, listing, orgId)` → bool — used in [id] GET routes for network-only 404s
- Ghost mode: `network_visible=false` orgs return empty arrays from every browse/list route
- Network-only listings/financing requests: return 404 (not 403) to non-members — never reveal they exist
- Supplier isolation: `GET /api/networks/[id]/members` is anchor-only; suppliers get 403
- Invite flow: existing orgs receive in-platform notification + email → accept/decline in /networks portal page
- New email invites: create `network_invite_tokens` row → invite landing page `/invite/[token]` → signup with pre-filled fields → auto-accept via `POST /api/invite/[token]/accept`
- Banks are NEVER part of supplier networks — network visibility has no effect on bank-facing financing requests
- `Networks` nav item added to BOTH anchor and supplier sidebars (position: after Financing, before Strike Rooms)
- Supplier dashboard: pending network invitations widget shown when `status='invited'` memberships exist

### Deal role determination — CRITICAL

**Never use `organizations.type` to determine buyer/seller on a deal.**
Always derive from `deals.buyer_org_id` / `deals.supplier_org_id`.

- In API routes: `deal.buyer_org_id === userData.org_id ? 'buyer' : 'supplier'`
- Canonical utility: `lib/deals/roles.ts` → `getDealRoles(deal, userOrgId)` and `getRolesFromListingType(listingType, listingOrgId, offerorOrgId)`

When creating a deal from an accepted offer, derive buyer/seller from `listing_type` (NOT `org.type`):
- `listing_type === 'po_request'` → poster = buyer, offeror = supplier
- `listing_type === 'product_service'` → poster = supplier, offeror = buyer

The `deals` table has `buyer_org_id` and `supplier_org_id` (NOT seller_org_id) — both NOT NULL with a CHECK(`buyer_org_id != supplier_org_id`). If roles are wrong, the INSERT fails.

### Counter-offer turn logic

Counter-offers are bidirectional. Turn is tracked via `offer_rounds[last].by_org_id`:
- No rounds yet (initial offer): listing owner goes first
- `lastRound.by_org_id === offerorOrgId` → listing owner's turn
- `lastRound.by_org_id === listingOrgId` → offeror's turn

Backend enforces this in `app/api/marketplace/offers/[id]/route.ts`.
Frontend reflects it in `app/(portal)/marketplace/listings/[id]/page.tsx` (Counter button hidden when it's not your turn; Accept always shown).

### Financing acceptance must NOT change deal status

`app/api/marketplace/financing/[id]/accept/route.ts` must NOT update `deals.status`. The deal flow continues normally. `financing_payment_active` is set to `true` only when the bank disburses.

The deal GET route (`app/api/deals/[id]/route.ts`) fetches the linked transaction when `financingRequest?.status === 'accepted'` (not only when `financing_payment_active`), so the transaction card appears immediately after bank offer acceptance.

**Bank-user lookup on the deal GET route**: bank users have no `org_id`, so `financing_request` cannot be looked up by `requesting_org_id = userData.org_id` the way org parties do. Instead, the route derives it from the bank's own `transactions` row on the deal via `transactions.financing_request_id`. The route also returns `bank_bank_account` (the bank's own receiving account, surfaced once financing is active — see Task 2 below) and `requester_bank_account` (the financing requester's own account, looked up by `entity_type:'organization', entity_id: financingRequest.requesting_org_id`, gated on `financingRequest.status` being `accepted`/`funded`) so the bank automatically sees where to disburse without the requester re-entering it.

### Two separate "contract" flows — do not conflate

There are two independent contract-signature features on a deal. They use different tables/columns, different API routes, and different participants:

1. **Deal-level trade contract** (`app/api/deals/[id]/contract/route.ts`) — between the buyer and supplier on the deal itself, independent of financing. Buyer submits (AI-generated via `callClaude`, or uploads) while `deal.status === 'agreed'` → deal advances to `contract_pending`, stored in `documents` (`document_kind:'trade_contract'`), columns `deals.contract_document_id/generated_at/submitted_at/submitted_by`. Supplier signs (`contract_supplier_signature/signed_at`) → deal advances to `confirmed`, optionally attaching `receiving_bank_account_id`; this auto-generates an AI commercial invoice (`document_kind:'commercial_invoice'`, `deals.deal_invoice_document_id/number/generated_at`, format `INV-${shortId}`). The same route also has an `action==='bank'`/`action==='bank_sign'` branch for a bank-submitted financing contract tied to `deal.financing_payment_active` (`deals.bank_contract_document_id/submitted_at/submitted_by`, `bank_contract_signature/signed_by/signed_at`) — this is deal-level, NOT the same row as #2 below.
2. **Financing-request contract** (`app/api/marketplace/financing/[id]/contract/route.ts`) — between the bank and the party that requested financing (buyer or supplier), scoped to the `financing_request`'s own `transactions` row (`esign_document_id`, `bank_signed_at`, `anchor_signed_at`/`supplier_signed_at` depending on `isRequesterBuyer`, `esign_completed_at`). This is the contract step in the **financing management lifecycle** (see below) and is rendered by `FinancingManagementCard.tsx`, not by the deal-level contract UI.

### Financing management lifecycle (Task 3/4 — this session)

Once a financing offer is accepted, the requesting party manages the rest of the lifecycle from the financing detail page (`app/(portal)/marketplace/financing/[id]/page.tsx`); the bank manages the same lifecycle from the deal detail page (`app/(portal)/deals/[id]/page.tsx`, `user_role === 'bank'` branch). Both render the shared `components/deals/FinancingManagementCard.tsx` (prop-driven, no internal fetching) against the same `financing_request`/`transactions` row, in three steps:

1. **Contract** — bank submits/generates a contract (`POST /api/marketplace/financing/[id]/contract`, sets `transactions.esign_document_id`/`bank_signed_at`); requester signs (`PATCH` same route, sets `anchor_signed_at` or `supplier_signed_at` depending on `isRequesterBuyer`, and `esign_completed_at` once both sides have signed).
2. **Disbursement** — once `esign_completed_at` is set, the bank sends a payment reference (`POST /api/transactions/[id]/disburse`, sets `disbursed_at`/`disbursed_by_user_id`/`disbursement_reference`). The bank automatically sees the requester's own bank account here (no manual entry) — see `requester_bank_account` above.
3. **Confirm receipt** — the requester confirms funds arrived (`POST /api/marketplace/financing/[id]/confirm-received`, sets `transactions.supplier_paid_at`).

On the deals page, `canFinance` (the "Request Financing" CTA gate) requires `user_role !== 'bank'` — banks never request financing on a deal, only manage it.

### Listing line items + AI extraction (procurement-flow-v2)

- `listing_line_items` rows can be entered manually or AI-extracted from an uploaded document via `POST /api/marketplace/listings/extract` (Haiku; accepts PDF/image/DOCX/DOC/TXT/CSV).
- CRUD: `GET/POST /api/marketplace/listings/[id]/line-items`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/marketplace/listings/[id]/line-items/[itemId]`.
- Document attach/replace for a listing: `app/api/marketplace/listings/[id]/document/route.ts`.
- The financing page's goods row shows BOTH the listing title and the actual goods/line-item description — previously only the title was shown, which was ambiguous when the listing title didn't match the underlying goods.

### Key design decisions
- deal_source: 'marketplace' | 'imported' | 'direct' on deals table
- Supabase Realtime on: room_messages, notifications,
  marketplace_offers, financing_request_offers, deals
- All AI calls use claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 (cost-sensitive)
- PassportScore recalculates on: deal completion, peer review received
- Private rooms auto-create on first counter-offer
- AI document generation fires on deal status → 'agreed'
- Financing acceptance creates a transaction row in the SCF engine
  (source='marketplace') — bridges marketplace to existing SCF flow
- Deal flow status machine: negotiating→agreed→contract_pending→documents_pending→confirmed→
  in_preparation→shipped→delivery_confirmed→[payment_due/overdue]→
  payment_confirmed→completed; financing_payment_active=true forks payment to bank
  (contract_pending is optional — only entered if the buyer submits a trade contract at 'agreed')
- financing_payment_active: bool on deals — set true when bank advance disbursed;
  blocks amendments, cancellation, and changes buyer's payment target to the bank
- payment_due_date: calculated from agreed_payment_terms (Net\d+ regex) on delivery confirmation
- amendment_history: JSONB array (AmendmentRecord[]); only one pending at a time;
  server rejects if financing_payment_active or status not in confirmed/in_preparation/active
- Cancellation: server-enforced; cancellable only at negotiating/agreed/documents_pending/
  confirmed/in_preparation/active; blocked at shipped and later; reason required at in_preparation
- Dispute: raised by buyer at shipped; both parties submit evidence; Strike Admin resolves
  with buyer_favor→cancelled, seller_favor→delivery_confirmed, mutual_settlement→completed,
  escalated→stays in_dispute
- Overdue cron: /api/deals/check-overdue (daily 08:00 UTC via vercel.json); 2-business-day
  grace period if financing_request still open/offers_received at due date (G9.1)
- Invoice duplicate detection: on commercial_invoice upload, checks documents table for
  same org; if found, logs agent_actions fraud_flagged and returns warning in response
- deal_events: write an event row after every status change or significant action;
  use this table for the deal timeline (not agent_actions)

### Supabase Storage buckets required
- kyb-documents (private) — KYB uploads
- deal-documents (private) — Deal import uploads
